# SBA-316-Mini-Game-Website

HI!

This repo contains my attempt at making my first set of interactive MiniGames
utilizing HTML, CSS and Javascript

It features games such as

1. PunI-shment mountain:
   A text based adventure with lots of puns and a hint of cringe, sure to bring smiles to all
   pun lovers and secret pun lovers. (You know who you are :P)

2. PokeManz: A list of familiar games, but with chooseable sprites provided by the Pokemon API

3. Game Pending:

4. News Letter(Pending):
   This is my attempt at creating Validation. . .
   No its not that I need validation. Am happy about myself...On most days......at least 1/2 the time.
   Enough about that!
   This was simply a requirment for my project!
   But if you want to give me positive Validation I wouldn't be opposed~

   5. A Spooky toogle switch. (Pending)
      Something Spoooooky, will happen if clicked, or not
      depends on how much i've really understand Javascript up to this point heh.

Future Updates:

PunIshment Mountain:
Need to add asycronous effect for a type writter. (Tried b4 but failed >.<>)
PunIshment mountain - Need to add actual story

PokeManz game section:

Pokemon run:
Search function still needs to be refined for pokemon with multiple form x.x
Fix hit detection for the Poke Run game.
Add instructions on how to play
(Potentially some bgm)
