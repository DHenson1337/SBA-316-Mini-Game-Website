HI!

This repo contains my attempt at making my first set of interactive MiniGames
utilizing HTML, CSS and Javascript and now Express!

It features games such as

1. PunI-shment mountain:
   A text based adventure with lots of puns and a hint of cringe, sure to bring smiles to all
   pun lovers and secret pun lovers. (You know who you are :P)

2. PokeManz: A list of familiar games, but with chooseable sprites provided by the Pokemon API

3. Game Pending:

4. News Letter(Pending):
   This is my attempt at creating Validation. . .
   No its not that I need validation. Am happy about myself...On most days......at least 1/2 the time.
   Enough about that!
   This was simply a requirment for my project!
   But if you want to give me positive Validation I wouldn't be opposed~

   5. Trivia Express!
      A trivia game thats run on an
      ejs engine view using express to run a mini Trivia Game/Blog site!

Future Updates:

(Make everything comptiable with ReactJS when we start using it)

PunIshment Mountain:
Need to add asycronous effect for a type writter. (Tried b4 but failed >.<>)
PunIshment mountain - Need to add actual story

PokeManz game section:

Pokemon run:
Search function still needs to be refined for pokemon with multiple form x.x
Add a spinning circle (not sure what it's called) for loading on longer searches
Increase the sprite size without messing up collision detection
(Add suppport for different sized screens)
